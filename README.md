## 🌟 The Story Behind TimeZen

TimeZen was born from a simple observation: students at our college were struggling to keep track of their schedules, find study materials, and get academic help when needed. We realized that while technology had advanced tremendously, our college experience was still fragmented across multiple platforms and paper schedules.

As a team of passionate students from the AI & Data Science department, we decided to build the solution ourselves. TimeZen represents our vision of how technology can make education more accessible, organized, and enjoyable.

### Our Mission

> "To empower every student at Amrutvahini College with the tools they need to succeed academically while making the learning journey more organized and enjoyable."
